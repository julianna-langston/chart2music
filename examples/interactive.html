<p><a href="http://www.chart2music.com" target="_blank">Chart2Music</a> lets you explore a chart using sound. To hear the chart, either tab to it or click on it, and use the arrow keys. If you're running a screen reader, it will speak after the sounds play. Press H to learn about other hotkeys available for each chart.</p>

<p>This chart is a reproduction of <a href="https://markets.ft.com/data">the <i>Financial Times</i> Markets Data page's Equity indices</a>. The chart was visually reproduced as closely as possible, to show how sonification can be seamlessly incorporated into existing complex data visualizations with no loss of functionality or change to visuals.</p>

<p><b>Special feature:</b> In this chart, the lines can be hidden by activating each line's label in the legend. After hiding a line from the view, that line will also be hidden from the sonification. Try it out by tabbing to the legend, using the arrow keys to navigate between legend items, and using the spacebar to show/hide individual lines. When you shift+tab back to the chart, notice how the group is no longer available. You can Page Up / Page Down to travel between lines, skipping the line you just hid.</p>
